      └── Semester Taking Course (ie Fall 2015)
          |
          └── Example #++ (ie Example 1 is the first folder, Example 2 is second, and etc)
              |
              └── Lesson Name (ie Homework 1)
                  |
                  └── Your actual code goes here
                  └── Your ReadMe also goes here
